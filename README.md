# dwd. Open License

The license as of September 18th, 2016

The license under which all dwd. projects are distributed under and the license you must include in redistributions of those projects.

## Where's the legal jargon?

To make the license as easy for everyday people to understand as possible, the dwd. Open License (or 'DOL') consists only of easy to understand bullet points. This way, the DOL can be truly open.

### Important note about this license

Only our engines, starter assets and development tools (collectively known as 'projects') are released under this license. *Our (upcoming) commercially-released builds based on these projects (or 'products') are proprietary releases, the proceeds from which we use to fund the development of the open projects.* While we (will) allow modifications of our commercial games, these mods must be non-commercial. Otherwise, use the engine to make your own games. You do not have to release your own games under this license, you only have to release modifications to the engine or development tools themselves.

## ~~Five~~ Four Freedoms

1. You are free to use dwd. projects for any purpose. Including commercial purposes and for products which compete with dwd's own products.
2. You are free to study the source code of dwd. projects and produce documentation of such code.
3. You are free to mirror dwd. projects.
4. You are free to port dwd. projects to operating systems and platforms other than their native platforms.

## ~~Five~~ Four Conditions

1. You must credit the dwd. project and the specific projects used as such: "©[year]; Code used from [project name/s] provided by DWD Project."
2. You must release any modifications to the source code under this license.
3. You must not use dwd. trademarks in the name/title or marketing of your projects.
   - Please also avoid making your project names confusingly similar to dwd. project names, even if they are not trademarked.
4. You must not make any affiliation between yourself and the dwd. project where one does not exist. 
